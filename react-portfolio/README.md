# React Portfolio

This is my portfolio page that was created using react.js.  The app is deployed at [kellyjohnson364.github.io/react-portfolio](https://kellyjohnson364.github.io/react-portfolio/).  The page includes an about me section, an area with contact information and a project section complete with links to both deployed apps and the repositories for each assignment.
